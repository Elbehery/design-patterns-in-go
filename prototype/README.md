# Prototype

The prototype design pattern involves creating objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning. It is especially useful when the construction of a new object is inefficient or complex.

In the prototype pattern, an instance of actual object (which is created by expensive database operation) is cloned to create a new object. This pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs.

This pattern involves implementing a prototype interface which tells to create a clone of the current object. It is used when creation of object directly is costly. So instead of creating a costly object, an existing object is copied.

In Go, this can be implemented by using the `Clone` method in an interface that all the struct who want to use the Prototype pattern needs to implement. The `Clone` method will return an instance of itself.

## Example

Let's imagine you're developing an application where you're dealing with different types of `Form` objects, each representing a form in a web application with many pre-filled fields. Each Form object is expensive to create (imagine it makes a network request or a database query to populate some of its fields). Therefore, instead of creating a new Form object each time a user visits a form, you might want to clone a pre-populated prototype.

```go
// RegistrationForm is a concrete type implementing Form
type RegistrationForm struct {
	Name  string
	Email string
}

// Clone method for RegistrationForm
func (r *RegistrationForm) Clone() Form {
	return &RegistrationForm{
		Name:  r.Name,
		Email: r.Email,
	}
}
```

In this example, when a new `RegistrationForm` is needed, instead of creating a new one from scratch (which may be expensive due to required default data), we clone a pre-populated `RegistrationForm`. The `Clone` function allows each type of form to specify how it should be copied, providing a lot of flexibility. In the real world, the `Clone` method could handle deep copying and other complex copying logic.

While it might seem unnecessary for a simple example like this, in a larger, more complex system, creating a new instance of an object can sometimes be a relatively expensive operation in terms of resources.

Consider a case where the constructor of a class makes a call to a database, retrieves a large amount of data, and populates a complex object graph. In this case, creating a new instance is a time and resource-consuming operation.

Now, suppose we often need to create objects that are identical or slightly different. In this case, it's much more efficient to clone the existing instance and modify it as needed, rather than creating a new one from scratch.

In the Prototype design pattern, the `Clone` method isn't just copying the fields of an object. It could also be handling some more complex operations that are required to correctly copy an object, such as deep copying and managing references.

Again, whether or not to use the Prototype pattern or simply clone/copy an object depends on the specific needs and constraints of your project. In many cases, especially for simple objects, a straightforward copy or a new object instantiation is preferable and leads to more readable code. However, in some scenarios where object creation is resource-intensive, the Prototype pattern can be a good approach.
